                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer currently in the Bay Area. Being an avid gamer early in life helped grow my
                    interest in tech and
                    ultimately led me towards learning how to create them as an engineer. Once I graduated from the Art
                    Institute for
                    engineering I was a game designer for 5 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still had a lot of interest in engineering, so I decided to refocus my efforts into that and
                    graduated from an
                    immersive 3 month coding bootcamp at App Academy. There I acquired skills to become a full stack
                    engineer using
                    technology like Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, Node.js, React.js, Redux, Git, HTML5, CSS3 / Sass, and
                    more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently in the market for software engineering positions, particularly pertaining to full
                    stack web development.
